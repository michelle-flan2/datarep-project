# datarep-project
ignore the folder project I uploaded that as a backup when I ran into problems with the original files Main.js and the public folder
are the orginal files.
The main.js file was commited through cmd like the public folder I just edited it to remove an error

Look at the wiki to find out how the website works

The Html file and js file has simple comments to help organise the files code

This project was done on my laptop which had node instaled that is why the files do not contain node
If you are running this on a computer without node installed download node from the cmd or put a node.exe into the folder
